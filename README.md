# NASA Exoplanet Query API
A Python package that streamlines querying from NASA's Exoplanet Archive. The package minimizes requests made to NASA's Exoplanet Archive by caching data in their archive.

## Features
- Ease of use sending requests to and recieving responses from NASA's Exoplanet Archive.
- Caches data from the archive to ensure excessive requests to the archive is avoided.
- Allows for easy querying of the archive but also more advanced querying for more specific requirements.

## Installation
```bash
pip install exopl_archive_api
```
## Usage
```python
import exopl_archive_api as neaa

query_client: neaa.ExoplanetQuery = neaa.ExoplanetQuery()

result = query_service.get_data("SELECT pl_name, pl_orbper FROM ps WHERE st_mass BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.2")

print(result)
```
## Cache Management
The cache is updated every Sunday at 00:00 (UTC). Cache is updated on a seperate server, ensuring calls to the archive are kept at a minimum.
